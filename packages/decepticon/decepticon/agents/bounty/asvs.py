"""ASVS 5.0 Audit Agent — OWASP Application Security Verification Standard.

Runs a full OWASP ASVS 5.0 verification pass over the recon-discovered
host / service / endpoint inventory. Dispatched as its own post-recon
objective: it consumes recon's findings and walks every applicable ASVS
chapter (V1 encoding, V2 validation/sanitization, V3 web-frontend, V6
authentication, V7 session management, V8 authorization, V9
self-contained tokens, V11 crypto, V13 API/web-service, ...) at the
level (L1 / L2 / L3) the engagement targets.

Hybrid verification: black-box DAST (curl / nuclei / testssl probing of
live endpoints) plus white-box review of any source made available,
emitting a per-chapter / per-requirement verdict (pass / fail / n-a)
with evidence — the same structured findings the bug-bounty reporters
turn into HackerOne / Bugcrowd submissions.
