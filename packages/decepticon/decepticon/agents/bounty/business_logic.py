"""Business-logic & Race-condition Agent — workflow abuse and TOCTOU.

Hunts the flaws no signature catches because the requests are
individually valid: multi-step workflow abuse (skipping / reordering /
replaying steps, negative quantities, price / coupon / currency
tampering), and concurrency races — TOCTOU and parallel-request
overruns (limit-overrun, double-spend, coupon / referral / withdrawal
races) exploited by firing many requests in a tight window.

Driven by the shared bash + web surface (scripted multi-step flows and
high-concurrency request bursts via curl / xargs / parallel). Confirmed
abuse chains are scope-checked and rendered as HackerOne / Bugcrowd
submissions.
