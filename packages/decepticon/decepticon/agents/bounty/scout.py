"""Bounty Scout — autonomous bug-bounty intake / program-selection agent.

The front door to the ``bounty`` bundle. The scout authenticates to the
HackerOne and Bugcrowd APIs (token identifier + value read from the
environment only), lists the programs the operator can access, and walks
a strict human-in-the-loop selection flow:

  authenticate → list open programs → operator picks one → fetch the
  program's structured scope + exclusions + reporting policy → operator
  confirms in-scope / out-of-scope / excluded classes → operator confirms
  reporting requirements and per-program rules → ``ingest_bounty_scope``
  writes the hard-enforced RoE (command parser + sandbox egress allowlist)
  → hand off to recon / ASVS / the specialist slate.

Per-program rules (no automated scanning, request-rate caps) are parsed
from the policy and, once the operator confirms, folded into the enforced
RoE — not merely displayed. The scout adds the platform-intake tools on
top of the shared bounty-workflow surface; everything else (slot stack,
skills, reporting) matches the rest of the bundle.
