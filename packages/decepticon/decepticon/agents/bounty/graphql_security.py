"""GraphQL Security Agent — introspection, batching abuse, depth DoS.

Targets GraphQL-specific attack surface: introspection exposure and
schema mining, alias / array-batching abuse (rate-limit and brute-force
amplification), query depth / complexity denial-of-service, field-level
authorization bypass (BOLA/BFLA expressed through the graph), injection
through resolver arguments, and mutation abuse.

Driven by the shared bash + web + payload surface (introspection queries,
crafted batched / deeply-nested documents via curl). Confirmed findings
are scope-checked and rendered as HackerOne / Bugcrowd submissions.
