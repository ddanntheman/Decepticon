"""Registry-backed capability discovery for agents.

Turns the machine-readable Kali capability registry
(:mod:`decepticon_core.capabilities`) into an agent-callable search tool
so a specialist can ask "what tool do I have for X, and how do I reach
it?" BEFORE hand-rolling a curl/Python loop or assuming a tool is
missing. Read-only: it inspects the static registry, runs no commands,
and touches no engagement state — so it carries no RoE/sandbox context
and is safe for every role.

The tool is role-aware. ``make_capability_search(role)`` binds an
agent's role so its discovery is scoped to what the role is expected and
allowed to reach: the role's :data:`ROLE_CAPABILITY_POLICY` default risk
ceiling is applied when the agent does not pass ``max_risk``, per-tool
role allowlists are honored, and the tools most relevant to the role's
kill-chain phases are surfaced under ``recommended_for_role``. None of
this hides tools the agent explicitly asks for — a higher ``max_risk``
always widens the search, and execution stays governed by RoE / HITL.
