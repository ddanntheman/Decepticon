"""Multi-model consensus — reduce false positives on critical findings.

For critical/high findings, routes the evidence through multiple
independent validation checks and requires consensus before reporting.
This dramatically reduces false positive rates on the findings that
matter most — the ones submitted to bug bounty programs or reported
to clients.

Validation checks:
1. **Evidence completeness** — does the finding have reproducible PoC?
2. **Severity calibration** — is the severity consistent with the evidence?
3. **Deduplication** — is this a known/duplicate finding?
4. **Exploitability assessment** — is the attack vector realistic?

The consensus tool structures this as a checklist that the agent
fills out. A finding passes consensus when all required checks pass.
Disagreements are flagged for human review.
