"""Telemetry allowlist invariants for the expanded tool arsenal.

The privacy-preserving program capture (:mod:`decepticon.runtime.programs`)
only measures "was the arsenal used?" if every tool the sandbox actually
ships is on the allowlist. These tests lock that — and the internal
consistency of the allowlist subsets — so a future tool addition that
forgets the telemetry side is caught in CI, not months later in a blind
retrospective.
